# Bank Customer's Churn Prediction
Customer churn is an imperative issue that is frequently connected with the existing cycle of the business.In recent year, churn prediction is becoming a very important issue in Banking and telecom industry. In order to deal with this problem, the industry must recognize these customers before they churn. Therefore, developing a unique classifier that will predict future churns is vital.

## Overview
This model is used to predict the fact whether the customer left the bank. The dataset is taken from Kaggle [Churn Modelling](https://www.kaggle.com/shubh0799/churn-modelling) credit to Shubham Kumar. It contains details of a bank's customers and the target variable is a binary variable reflecting the fact whether the customer left the bank (closed his account) or he continues to be a customer.

### Summary about the features and their types in the dataset:

1) RowNumber : Serial number
2) CustomerId :Unique Ids for bank customer identification
3) Surname : Customer's last name
4) CreditScore : Credit score of the customer
5) Geography : The country from which the customer belongs
6) Gender : Male or Female

10) NumOfProducts : Number of bank products the customer is utilising
11) HasCrCard : Binary Flag for whether the customer holds a credit card with the bank or not
12) IsActiveMember : Binary Flag for whether the customer is an active member with the bank or not
13) EstimatedSalary : Estimated salary of the customer in Dollars
14) Exited : Binary flag 1 if the customer closed account with bank and 0 if the customer is retained

## Technical Aspect
1) Exploratory Data Analysis using Python Libraries i.e., seaborn, plotly, matplotlib
2) Model build on Artificial Neural Network
3) Hyperparameter optimization using Keras Tuner
Note: Code is available in this repo
